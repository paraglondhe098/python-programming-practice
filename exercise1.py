Dic1={"Set":"A set in mathematics is a collection of well defined and distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.",
      "Subset":" A set A is a subset of another set B if all elements of the set A are elements of the set B. In other words, the set A is contained inside the set B. The subset relationship is denoted as AâŠ‚B.",
      "Relation":"A relation between two sets is a collection of ordered pairs containing one object from each set. If the object x is from the first set and the object y is from the second set, then the objects are said to be related if the ordered pair (x,y) is in the relation. A function is a type of relation.",
      "Function":". A function is a relation for which each value from the set the first components of the ordered pairs is associated with exactly one value from the set of second components of the ordered pair."
      ,"Power set":" We have defined a set as a collection of its elements so, if S is a set then the collection or family of all subsets of S is called the power set of S and it is denoted by P(S)."}
